# Recruiter Delete/Deactivate

1. If recruiter is delete then job posts of the recruiter will delete or not?
- If not delete and marked isDeleted true, then we have can use it in our admin analytics to analyze:
a. Which role or position is performing well and demanding in market
b. Whats market value of role
c. Top hiring companies
d. Qualification analysis for the role
e. Experience and Responsibilities relation - means how much experience person would people recommending for the set of responsibilities.

- If delete the post data:
a. Only storage will impact
b. Orphan data will be taking space
c. Data searching, filtering make little bit overhead.

2. How recruiters will be verify after email and mobile? - 4 docs -> pan, company details, etc. ( manual )
- How do we know the company they are hiring for are authentic?

3. Do I allow recruiters to change their professional details after registration? - no
a. If no - then if recruiter what to change hiring to other company he/she needs to create a new account.
- In future, if we shift recruiter accounts to subscription model then it may be very challenging for users to use the application, as they need to pay for every new account 

b. If yes, then do I re-verify them with kyc process? If yes, then should there any restrictions that would apply till kyc like stop job posting, shift account to hold, etc.  

4. Can muliple recruiters create account for one company ? - no
- If yes, then they can post jobs under the same company and on company, jobs were list from each all recruiter accounts of the company
- If yes, how can verify that acount created by recruiter on befalf of a company is authorized person. Because, there are uncertain chances anyone can create account for xyz company and post jobs under it. Which may cause data redundancy and inconsistency.

5. If I preview user details in applications list, then on delete account by seeker will applicant remove from post - I think it's correct

If no - then I need to add extra fields in applied post to store applicant details and then preview them - It will helps to keep history of applicants

6. If post is delete or recruiter is delete do I need to remove applied history from all seekers ?
If no - then How can I display post details to applied the seeker, because the data is dependent on populate postMId
